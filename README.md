> Rush 02 from 42 School â€” a project to convert numeric strings into their word equivalents.  
> This version supports both **English** and **Armenian** word output.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Rush 02 is a logic-focused C project in which the program receives a numeric string (e.g. `123`) and prints it as words (e.g. `one hundred twenty-three`).  
The program splits the number into logical parts (units, tens, hundreds, thousands) and searches a dictionary to map each numeric value to its word form.

This implementation supports both:
- **English**
- **Armenian**

### âœ… Example Output

#### English

Example for `rush02(123)`:

```
one hundred twenty-three
```
