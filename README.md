# Rush 02 â€” Number to Words (Multilingual)

> Rush 02 from 42 School â€” a project to convert numeric strings into their word equivalents.  
> This version supports both **English** and **Armenian** word output.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Rush 02 is a logic-based C project where the program reads a numeric string (e.g., `123`) and prints it in words (e.g., `one hundred twenty-three`). The challenge includes parsing input, splitting numbers into logical groups (hundreds, thousands, etc.), and matching them against a dictionary.

In this implementation, the dictionary and output support **both English and Armenian**.

### âœ… Example Output

#### English

```bash
./rush02 123
